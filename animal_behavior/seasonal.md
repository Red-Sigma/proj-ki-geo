# Bison: 

Spring (March to May) 

In the spring, bison often focus on foraging and regaining strength after the harsh winter. 

Calving season begins, and bison are protective of their newborn calves. 

Social interactions within the herd are common as they establish hierarchies. 

 

Summer (June to August): 

Summer is a time of active feeding, with bison grazing on grasses and sedges. 

They may disperse into more open areas, seeking green and nutritious vegetation. 

Bison may be more diurnal, with increased daytime activity. 

 

Fall (September to November): 

The fall marks the rutting season for bison, and they become more aggressive during this time. 

They engage in mating behaviors, including vocalizations and displays of dominance. 

Foraging continues as they prepare for the upcoming winter. 

 

Winter (December to February): 

Winter is a challenging time for bison due to snow cover and reduced food availability. 

They may switch their diet to sedges and other available plants. 

Bison may be more crepuscular, with activity concentrated during the morning and evening. 

 

# Elk (Wapiti): 

Spring (March to May): 

Spring is a time of renewal for elk, with the growth of new vegetation. 

They focus on grazing and foraging to regain strength after the winter. 

Social interactions occur, but they are not as intense as during the rut. 

 

Summer (June to August): 

Summer is a period of active feeding, with elk grazing on grasses and browsing on vegetation. 

Elk often form herds, and the presence of dominant bulls becomes more pronounced. 

Calves are born in late spring or early summer. 

 

Fall (September to November): 

The fall is the rutting season for elk, marked by increased vocalizations and territorial behaviors. 

Bulls engage in intense competition for mates. 

Elk continue to feed but may become more focused on mating activities. 

 

Winter (December to February):  

Winter brings harsh conditions, and elk adjust their behavior to conserve energy. 

They may move to lower elevations or seek shelter in dense forests to protect against cold and snow. 

Grazing is limited, and they may rely on stored body fat for sustenance. 

 

# Moose: 


Spring (March to May): 

Spring is a time of active feeding for moose, as fresh vegetation becomes available. 

Moose may browse on shrubs, aquatic plants, and young trees. 

This season can also be marked by territorial displays among bull moose. 

 

Summer (June to August): 

Summer is a period of continued feeding and growth for moose, particularly calves. 

Moose may spend time in or near water bodies to forage on aquatic vegetation. 

Social interactions are relatively calm compared to the rutting season. 

Fall (September to November): 

  

The fall is the rutting season for moose, with bulls seeking out cow moose for mating. 

Territorial behavior and vocalizations increase as they compete for mates. 

Feeding continues but may be less of a focus during the rut. 

 

Winter (December to February): 

Winter brings challenging conditions, and moose may move to coniferous forests or dense cover to find food and shelter. 

They rely on stored fat reserves for sustenance. 

Winter ticks and parasites can be a concern during this season, affecting moose populations.
