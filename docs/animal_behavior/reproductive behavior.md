# Bison: 


Mating Season: 

#### The mating season for bison, also known as the rut, begins in late July and extends through early September. 

During this time, mature bulls become more aggressive and competitive for mating opportunities. 

Courtship: 

Courtship behaviors involve bulls displaying their dominance through vocalizations, wallowing (rolling in mud or dust), and making a series of displays like head shaking. 

Dominant bulls compete for the attention of receptive females (cows) and form harems. 

Mating: 

Once a dominant bull has successfully courted a cow, mating occurs. 

This can involve several attempts and may result in a successful mating. 

Calving: 

After a gestation period of approximately 9 months, cows give birth to calves in the spring, usually in April or May. 

 

 

# Elk (Wapiti): 

Mating Season: 

#### The elk rut occurs in the fall, generally from September to November. 

This is the period when bulls become highly active in seeking mates. 

Bugling: 

One of the most iconic behaviors during the rut is bugling. Bulls emit loud, distinctive calls to attract cow elk and signal their presence. 

Bugling helps establish dominance and claim territory. 

Challenging Competitors: 

Bulls engage in physical confrontations to establish dominance. These confrontations can involve pushing, shoving, and locking antlers. 

Harems: 

Dominant bulls gather and protect groups of cows (harems) for mating. 

Subordinate bulls may try to steal cows from dominant bulls, leading to further confrontations. 

Mating and Calving: 

After successfully attracting and securing a harem, mating occurs. 

Calves are born in the spring, typically in May or June, following a gestation period of about 240 to 262 days. 

 

# Moose: 

Mating Season: 

#### The moose rut takes place in the fall, typically in September and October. 

This is when bull moose are most active in seeking mates. 

Vocalizations: 

During the rut, bull moose emit deep, resonant vocalizations to attract cow moose and signal their presence. 

These calls can be heard from a distance and help establish dominance. 

Dominance Displays: 

Bull moose engage in dominance displays, which can involve thrashing vegetation with their antlers, urinating on themselves, and making themselves appear larger and more intimidating. 

Competitive Behavior: 

Bulls may engage in physical confrontations to establish dominance and secure mating opportunities. 

These confrontations can involve clashing antlers and shoving. 

Mating and Calving: 

After establishing dominance and attracting a cow, mating occurs. 

Calves are typically born in late spring, following a gestation period of about 7 months.
