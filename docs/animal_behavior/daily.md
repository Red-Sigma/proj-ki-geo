# Bison: 

Bison are most active during the day. Their daily behavior can be summarized as follows: 

- Morning Grazing: Bison are known to begin their day by grazing on grasses. They feed in the morning hours when temperatures are cooler and the sun is not as intense. 
- Midday Rest: During the hottest part of the day, bison often seek shade or water sources to rest and cool off. They may gather near water bodies to drink and wallow in the mud, which helps them regulate their body temperature and protect themselves from biting insects. 
- Afternoon Grazing: As the day progresses and temperatures become milder, bison resume grazing. They continue to feed on grasses and other vegetation to meet their nutritional needs. 
- Evening Grazing: In the late afternoon and early evening, bison may graze again, taking advantage of the cooler temperatures. This grazing activity continues until dusk.
- Night Rest: Bison are less active during the night. They typically rest or sleep, with some individuals taking turns to keep watch for potential predators. Bison have relatively poor eyesight but rely on their excellent sense of hearing to detect threats. 

- Social Interaction: Bison are social animals and often live in large herds. Throughout the day, they engage in various social interactions, including grooming, playing, and establishing dominance hierarchies within the herd. 

# Elk (Wapiti): 

Elk are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active during the dawn and dusk. Their daily behavior includes: 

- Dawn Feeding: Elk are known to feed primarily during the early morning hours. They graze on grasses and browse on plants, leaves, and shrubs. This is when they actively forage for food. 
- Midday Rest: As the day gets warmer, elk seek shelter or shade to rest. They may also ruminate during this time, regurgitating and re-chewing their food for better digestion. 
- Afternoon Feeding: Elk may resume feeding in the late afternoon, especially if food is scarce or during times when they need to build up energy reserves. 
- Social Hierarchy: Elk herds are often led by a dominant female, or cow. Bulls, on the other hand, may form small groups or even travel alone, particularly outside the mating season. 
- Dusk Activity: The evening hours are when elk become more active again, grazing and browsing for food. This is also a time when they may engage in social interactions and mating behaviors during the rutting season. 
- Night Rest: Elk are less active during the night, with many individuals resting or sleeping. Like bison, they have crepuscular behavior, and their vision is adapted to low light conditions. 

# Moose: 

Moose have somewhat flexible daily behavior, but they are often crepuscular and may exhibit the following patterns: 

- Early Morning Feeding: Moose may start their day by feeding on vegetation, including leaves, twigs, and water plants. They primarily browse for food, favoring woody plants. 
- Midday Rest: During the heat of the day, moose seek shade or cooler areas to rest. This is a time when they conserve energy and reduce exposure to heat. 
- Afternoon Feeding: In the late afternoon, moose may continue to browse and feed on vegetation, especially in areas where food is abundant. 
- Solitary Behavior: Unlike bison and elk, moose are often solitary animals. They may form small groups in the winter to conserve heat, but they typically live alone. During the rutting season, bull moose may seek out cow moose for mating. 
- Night Rest: Moose are less active at night, and they may rest or sleep during these hours. In the winter, they may browse on available vegetation even in the dark.
