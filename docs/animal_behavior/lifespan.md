# Bison: 

Typical Lifespan: About 20 to 25 years in the wild. 

Factors Impacting Lifespan: 

Predation: Bison can be preyed upon by wolves, which can reduce their lifespan. 

Disease: Disease outbreaks can affect bison populations. 

Human Activities: Hunting and habitat loss due to human activities can influence their lifespan. 

 

# Elk (Wapiti): 

Typical Lifespan: 15 to 20 years in the wild. 

Factors Impacting Lifespan: 

Predation: Elk are preyed upon by wolves, bears, and mountain lions, which can affect their lifespan. 

Hunting: Legal hunting can reduce elk populations and their lifespan. 

Disease: Diseases such as chronic wasting disease (CWD) can impact elk health and longevity. 

 

# Moose: 

Typical Lifespan: About 15 to 20 years in the wild. 

Factors Impacting Lifespan: 

Predation: Moose are vulnerable to predation by wolves and bears, which can influence their lifespan. 

Disease: Parasites like winter ticks and diseases like brainworm can affect moose health and longevity. 

Human Interactions: Vehicle collisions with moose, hunting, and habitat fragmentation due to human development can impact their lifespan.
