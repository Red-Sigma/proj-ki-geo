## What data do we have?
### Bison Data
- Weight: adult males 460kg - 900kg, adult females 360kg - 540kg
- Eat: Grasses (herbivores) (15kg grasses & 30 gallons of water per day)
- Types: American and European
- Behavior: Social animals and often live in large herds. (Mature bulls are found either as solitary animals or in small groups of their own)
- In May and June when bison are very protective of newborn calves.
- Mating season: Begins late July and carries through until early September (During the rut, bison are more aggressive)
- Baby: Orange-red color
- lifespan: About 25 years
- Migration: Not all bison migrate. Only in dry regions of the prairies were long migrations essential to find new grazing grounds and watering holes. (Only in Alberta does a large bison migration of 250 kilometers take place twice a year.)
- Natural enemies
  - Wolves
- Extra: Have poor eyesight but they have great senses of hearing


### Elk Data (Wapiti)
- Weight: adult males 227 to 454 kg, adult females 181 to 272 kg
- They prefer areas with a mix of open fields for grazing and dense forests for cover and protection
- herbivores: grasses, plants, leaves, and bark, shrubs and twigs (if food is scarce)
- Behavior: they form herds especially in mating season
- an herd is led by an elk cow
- bulls form small groups and may even travel alone
- Elk prefer open woodlands and avoid dense unbroken forests
- consume an average of 9.1 kilograms (20 lb) of vegetation daily (depends on the season)
- Reproduction: one or two calves in the spring after a gestation period of about 240 to 262 days
- reproductively mature at 16 months of age.
- lifespan: 20+ years, avg 26.8 years

### Moose Data

- elk in Europe
- live alone except for winter when they sometimes form small groups
- natural enemies
  - siberian tiger
  - wolves
- eats: grass, leaves, twigs, willow, birch, maple shoots, water plants
- pregnant for 7 months

## What data do we need?
- population of each species
- specific info on species: life span, eating habits, herd behavior
- Höhendaten
- Niederschlag
- Temperaturen
