## What data do we have?
### Bison Data
- Weight: adult males 460kg - 900kg, adult females 360kg - 540kg
- Eat: Grasses (herbivores) (60kg grasses & 113 liter of water per day)
  -  calves eating 9kg
  -  young adults eating 20-29kg  
- sleep 7–9 hours per night
- Types: American and European
- Behavior: Social animals and often live in large herds. (Mature bulls are found either as solitary animals or in small groups of their own)
- In May and June when bison are very protective of newborn calves.
- Mating season: Begins late July and carries through until early September (During the rut, bison are more aggressive)
- Baby: Orange-red color
- lifespan: About 25 years
- Migration: Not all bison migrate. Only in dry regions of the prairies were long migrations essential to find new grazing grounds and watering holes. (Only in Alberta does a large bison migration of 250 kilometers take place twice a year.)
- Natural enemies
  - Wolves
- Extra: Have poor eyesight, but they have great senses of hearing


### Elk Data (Wapiti)
- Weight: adult males 227 to 454 kg, adult females 181 to 272 kg
- Eat: consume an average of 9.1 kilograms (20 lb) of vegetation daily (depends on the season). Elk generally eat four to eight times a day depending on the availability of food.
- Drink: 30-45 liters per day, but a larger bull elk can drink up to 75 liters. Elk can go without water for long periods of time, but they will drink when given the opportunity. They typically drink once a day, but during hot weather or when eating dry food, they may drink more frequently.
- Sleep: Elks would have two sleep cycles in a day and may rest from 1 to 4 hours. They sleep in intervals rather than a single cycle. They are mostly sleeping during the day.  After a night of eating, watering, and socializing, the elk will typically retreat to a thickly wooded area to sleep for the day, often near the top of a high ridge. Even if they are awake during the day, they are shy creatures and will remain hidden, emerging only to drink or eat.
- Activity: Elks are most active in the middle of the night or early in the morning when they will be providing for their young, going to the watering hole, or socializing with other elks.
- Summer: During the summer elk tend to stay closer to reliable water sources
- They prefer areas with a mix of open fields for grazing and dense forests for cover and protection
- herbivores: grasses, plants, leaves, and bark, shrubs and twigs (if food is scarce)
- Behavior: they form herds especially in mating season
- an herd is led by an elk cow
- bulls form small groups and may even travel alone
- Elk prefer open woodlands and avoid dense unbroken forests
- Reproduction: one or two calves in the spring after a gestation period of about 240 to 262 days
- reproductively mature at 16 months of age.
- lifespan: 20+ years, avg 26.8 years


### Moose Data

- elk in Europe
- water consumption 140 gallons(529 liter) per day
- 18-27 kg of food per day
- sleep?????
- live alone except for winter when they sometimes form small groups
- natural enemies
  - siberian tiger
  - wolves
- eats: grass, leaves, twigs, willow, birch, maple shoots, water plants
- pregnant for 7 months

## What data do we need?
- population of each species
- specific info on species: life span, eating habits, herd behavior
- Höhendaten
- Niederschlag
- Temperaturen
